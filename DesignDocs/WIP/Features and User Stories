 As a user I want to be able to:
 -declare my cooking knowledge/expertise (beginner, intermediate, Gordon Ramsay) at the beginning 
 -take pictures of recipes so I don't have to type them in (live OCR)
 -Attach pictures to ingredients, steps, tools and final outputs/products so that I can visually follow along
 -Export/Import recipes to share them with others
 -Convert between standard units (cups|ml, F|C) so that i can adapt recipes to my kitchen
 -test my knowledge/expertise next time I cook.
 -keep track of receipes I've made
 -mark recipes as a 'Favorite' so that I can easily find recipes that I liked
