One of the major things that has been a hiccup on the road to success for this project has been the Pictures and their implementation. Throughout the development of this app, pictures have single handedly thrown up the most issue iteration through iteration. We started off naive, as one would expect, thinking about how easy it would be to add an image to a simple element. It wasn't all too bad until we had to figure out how to work from outside the /res/ folder. This is when the real issues started popping up, streams being closed before they were even accessed, bitmap factories not throwing exceptions, not returning nulls but just printing to console, the database changing the way that the picture was encoded. It has been trial after trial and yet we are still not much further ahead than we were on day one and on top of that we have been through several piles of technical debt. From just using the /res/ folder to live loading each picture into the database on app launch, we are still yet to figure out a 'proper' implementation. We would like to improve the picture situation this iteration by once and for all getting the picture's data stored in the database then being able to access it from there. The success measure for this issue will be a simple one. We can consider it truly finished when we open the app and we see the included recipes self-fill their pictures (which are known to be from the database, no more of this /res/ joking around)

Another thing that has not been all too successful with this project was the seeming inability to implement our multitude of initial Features and user stories. Many of which seemed quite simplistic and looked like they would take no time at all to implement quickly ballooned out of control once put under the design microscope. One thing in particular that we picked on was the 'Ingredients conversion' user story (#13) This task seemed to be quite small and simple to tackle, however, once we started to think specifically about the different measures of ingredients, specifically volume and weight it became apparent that we would need to come up with and store some form of density for each ingredient in order to do weight to volume conversions properly. (Generally, you find larger bulk recipes go by weight rather than cups/ml) While we were unable to tackle this monumentus task this iteration (and it's improvement from current would have been an easy 'just implement it') it would have been an easy success to measure in that it would have just been if the user was able to set their preferred measurements somewhere and every time a recipe was displayed it would work to use those preferences rather than what may have actually been stored with the recipe.

Finally, the last thing that we are going to pick on is the shopping list. We were unhappy that it wasn't as intuitive as we had originally hoped (putting it up against the other list-like apps out there) in that it had some unique function (press to delete) which wasn't entirely evident to users and could cause frustration if their actions were causing the functionality to be triggered without them noticing. This was improved in the last iteration with a large revamp of the shopping list. The items in the list are now more separated and each one has a clearly visible function for deleting or adding to a bulk search. The success of the issue for this iteration can be measured in observing users and their interaction with the shopping list between the iteration and the current. The objectiveness can be pulled out of how much time it takes users to figure out how to search by specific ingredients and how to remove ingredients from their shopping list.
