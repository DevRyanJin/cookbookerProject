#CookBooker
---
CookBooker is a recipe collection for people who want to follow recipes in order to prepare and consume decent food.
The CookBooker system will be used to assist those that wish to follow step by step instructions, producing various dishes.
It can equally be used by those that are already relatively familiar with some recipe but require a reminder to the steps, ingredients or other attributes related to a recipe.

The system can display any type of recipe in a simple to understand layout which will allow cooks to quickly read recipes without being burdened by deciphering them.
This also allows cooks to easily move between recipes and find certain aspects where they expect them to be. We hope to be able to speed up food preparation and enhance the overall joy of creation for the cook.

The beauty of Cookbooker is that it is simple enough for beginner cooks and chefs to use, yet, also meets the needs of experienced chefs by including features allowing them to expand on existing recipes.
This broad scope of included skill levels allows our system to be used in a wide market and does not need to be targeted to any specific user.

Cookbooker is rich in features including, but not limited to;
sharing of recipes so cooks can distribute them to colleagues, friends, and family;
unit conversions, so recipes shared from different cultures may be recreated using measurements that the cook is comfortable with;
authoring of the chef or cook's own original creations.
Cookbooker does not merely allow cooks to learn new recipes and refine others but, also encourages exploration in the vast world of food.
That is to say, CookBooker's aim is to easily make available for its users the ability to retrieve recipes using the system; in addition, cooks and chefs are able to share and communicate effectively using built-in features.

Making CookBooker user-friendly, easily and readily available to you, the cook is important to us.
Therefore, the system is envisioned as a mobile application to support you as a cook or chef to work hand in hand with the system.
The system is also anticipated to expand its capability to support and work under multiple devices.

Furthermore, Cookbooker will allow for investigation within different cultures and culinary styles.
Cooks will be able to alter recipes as they please, discovering extra ingredients or substitutions on their own, or take suggestions from the app to put new twists on old classics and discover the ultimate dish.
This fosters creativity in the cooks when they're preparing foodstuffs and allows them to develop their own personal style.

The system may be considered a success once cooks are observed surpassing the following criteria.
To begin with, they must be able to prepare food more efficiently after prolonged use of the system, this may be observed by using timed, within-subject testing.
Second, they must prepare food they are familiar with to a higher quality than they used to. Metrics may include presentation, taste, and closeness to the dish they were looking to replicate.
Third, they must be able to re-imagine and re-create recipes based on limited resources both in ingredients and with some monetary budget.
And finally, if any of the previous three criteria were attained using some other cook's annotations, we will consider Cookbooker a successful product.
