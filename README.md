To run the app you can either download and install the [.apk](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2019/cookbooker/blob/master/Cookbooker.apk) to a device/emulator or you may clone the project into Android Studio using [this link.](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2019/cookbooker.git) and run it using their interfaces.
Once the app is running you will be greeted by our three default recipes. To view the **details** pertaining to a specific recipe simply click on the one which interests you. If you notice something you wish to edit, in the top right corner is an **edit** button which allows you to change the recipe.
If you would like to instead add a brand new recipe, simply open the menu on the main page and select **New Recipe**, enter your recipe details and click the save button in the top right corner.
If you get to the point of too many recipes and need to find a specific one, be sure to make use of the **search** functionality in the main menu.
If you are just unsure of what you want to eat, check out the **Random Recipe** in the main menu.
If you want to go shopping be sure to use our **shopping list**, where you can check off certain items.
A hidden feature is in the shopping list where you can enter the contents of your fridge into the shopping list and search for recipes which contain the selected ingredients!
